Math Foundations for Machine Learning and Data Science (Work In Progress). I mainly refer to MIT OCW, if available the "OCW Scholar" courses, which are considered the most "complete" (videos, scripts, exercises,...) for a given subject.

## 1 Math Foundations


### 1.1 Calculus
*Differentiation and Integration*  
Single Variable:
